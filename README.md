# Classification_of_obesity
# Predicting whether an individual is obese or not  based on their eating habits and physical condition

Objective: Comparing performance of different clsssification models on Obesity dataset

Machine learning models: 

1) logistic regression
2) Decision tree
3) Random forest

Deep learning model : Long short term memory (LSTM) 

Evaluation metrics: 10-fold cross validation

Models evaluation based on : 
1) Accuracy, 
2) Sensitivity, 
3) Specificity, 
4) Precision, 
5) F1_score, 
6) Error rate, 
7) Negative predictive value, 
8) False positive rate, 
9) False Discovery Rate, 
10) False negative rate, 
11) Balanced Accuracy(BACC), 
12) True Skills Statistics(TSS), 
13) Heidke Skill Score (HSS)


#Outcome: Random forest outperforms ass other models.
